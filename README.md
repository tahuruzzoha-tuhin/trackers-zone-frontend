### About Project 
   - This site is about a Tour Package Booking System. We take all the responsibilities of our tourists and take order from this site. It's a task of assignment 11 given by programming hero. They didn't provide me any design. I've used my own idea to generate this UI as well as functionalities.


#### Technolgy I've Used: 
- I've used react to develop the UI of this site
- I used font-awesome for icons. And also used react bootstrap for responsiveness and faster design.
- I placed all the data in Mongodb and load from there.
- Context api was used to get data easily from all the route
- Used Private Route, Google SignIn and Email Sign in , Sign Up for Authentication
-I've created my own backend as well as some api's to connect client side to the database
